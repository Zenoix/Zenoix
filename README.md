<h2 align="center">Hello and Welcome! My name is Jeff Wang ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>I'm currently a high school student with an interest in data science, programming, and learning new skills and information. Currently, I am finishing my last year of high school while completing data science and programming projects. The skills I am focusing on right now is how to perform data science tasks using Python as that is the language I am most experienced in, however, I will eventually be learning other skills such as R, SQL, and statistics to help me become a data scientist.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to get in touch with me for a chat or maybe just to play some computer games together, contact me on whatever platform you prefer listed below in the "Where to find me section". </p>
